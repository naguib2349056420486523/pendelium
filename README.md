This project is a physics lab simulation that shows a ball hanging on a string and moving like a pendulum.
The user can change values such as the length of the string, the mass of the ball, and the gravity to see how the motion changes.
There is an option to turn on constant wind, which pushes the ball and affects how it moves.
The motion can be started by pressing the push button or by dragging the ball by hand.
This project helps students understand motion, gravity, and basic physics in a simple way.
